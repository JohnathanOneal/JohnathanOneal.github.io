During my time at Tufts University, I had the privilege of balancing academic pursuits with collegiate athletics as a member of the football team. This experience provided valuable lessons in time management, teamwork, and personal growth.
Notable recognitions include:
- Semi-Finalist for the William Campbell Trophy, acknowledging the combination of academic excellence, community service, and on-field performance across all divisions\
  (Notable Winners: Peyton Manning, Tim Tebow, Justin Herbert)
- CoSIDA Academic All-District honoree, an award that recognizes the nation's top student-athletes for their combined performances on the field and in the classroom

Additionally, For three years I served as the Student Athlete Advisory Committee Team Representative for Football, which allowed me to contribute to the broader athletic community at Tufts.
## Moving Forward
The combination of academics, athletics, and leadership experiences has equipped me with a unique skill set. I look forward to leveraging these abilities in my professional career, continuing to solve complex problems.
I welcome opportunities for professional connection and intellectual exchange. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss data engineering, mathematics, or sports; especially the intersection of the three.
