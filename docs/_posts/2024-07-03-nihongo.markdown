## Welcome to the Weekly Japanese Corner! 

Every week, I’ll challenge myself to write a short passage in Japanese without relying on translation tools. This practice will help me think more naturally in Japanese, strengthen my writing skills, and build confidence in being able to express my ideas in a foreign language. Mistakes are part of the journey, and by embracing them, I can learn and improve over time. Through this habit, I hope to deepen my understanding of the language and track my progress along the way.

*Disclaimer: I take full responsibility for my Japanese mistakes—but absolutely none for whatever chaos Google Translate might create when interpreting them.*
